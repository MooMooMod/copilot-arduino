Instructables:

Supplies
We need thes items to make the drone,

For the drone-
Frame
Motors – Provide thrust, brushless DC motors, each separately controlled by an ESC
ESCs – Electronic Speed Controller, regulates how much power the motors get, connected to FC
Propellers – 5-inch racing props for less thrust but more speed, 9-11 inch props for stable, aerial photography flights 
Battery – 2S, 3S, 4S, etc, S = voltage, more S = more speed
FC - STM32F103C8T6
IMU (MPU 6050) – Various sensors that help your quad know where it is

For the transmitter-
NRF24L01 Transceiver Module
NRF24L01 + PA + LNA
Potentiometer
Servo Motor
Toggle Switch
Joystick
Arduino Pro Mini
